this keyword =>
  this keyword is that it always refers to the object that is executing the
  current function.

we all know that all functions that are part of an object are called methods.
So if this keyword is being used by a method, then this keyword would always refer
to the object.That's the rule number one.And if this keyword is being used by a
normal function or a function that is not a part of an object, then this keyword
would refer to the global object that is the window object in case of browser and global
object in case of node. And that's our rule.

method -> object
function -> window, global

/*
So I'll expand the user object. You'll see that three methods are added to the
user object itself and not to the prototype of the user object.
If you remember when we created an instance of user using our class, all these
three methods that is add point login and log out were a part of the prototype
object and now only the constructor is a part of the prototype object.

But all these three methods now exist inside the user object and not inside
the prototype of the user object. And to understand this behavior and add our
methods to prototype of the user object, we will need to understand what prototypes
are and why classes add these methods to prototypes of the objects.
We are going to understand this by first understanding what is a prototype.
